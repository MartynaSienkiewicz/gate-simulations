The potential in a gate-defined quantum dot system can be modelled by solving the Poisson equation. For a simpler first step, we can approximate the gates as 2D charged objects and calculate the electrostatic potential using methods like finite difference, finite element, or using Green's functions for the Coulomb potential.

Here, I implement a simplified approach using a 2D model to simulate the electrostatic potential.

The model will calculate the electrostatic potential generated by the gate electrodes:

1. Electrodes as Voltage Sources: 
The gate electrodes are modelled as regions that apply a voltage. These gates induce an electrostatic potential in the region around them.

2. Calculating the Potential: 
The electrostatic potential is computed due to the gates, assuming they are conducting electrodes with specified voltages (negative for depletion).

3. 2DEG Response: 
The 2DEG responds to this potential by being depleted when the potential due to the gates exceeds the Fermi energy (i.e., when the conduction band is pushed above the Fermi level).

4.Self-consistent Solution: 
Ideally, you would solve this iteratively by calculating how the potential from the gates depletes the 2DEG, then updating the charge distribution and recalculating the potential, but a simpler first approximation for now can just be modelling the gate potentials directly.]

CURRENT STATE OF MODEL:
Currently, all the model does is applies the specified voltage to a mesh grid in the shape of the gate. It is Gaussian blurred on the contour map. The model is currently very simple as the grid is either zero or or at the specified voltage, the potential blur is simply a visual Gaussian blur. Currently in the process of building the model

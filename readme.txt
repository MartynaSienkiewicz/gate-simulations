The potential in a gate-defined quantum dot system can be modeled by solving the Poisson equation. However, for a simpler first step, we can approximate 
the gates as 2D charged objects and calculate the electrostatic potential using methods like finite difference, finite element, or using Green's functions 
for the Coulomb potential.

Here, I implement a simplified approach using a 2D model to simulate the electrostatic potential.
